# Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

## Overview

This project implements topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. LDA is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that discovers abstract topics within a collection of documents by analyzing word patterns.

## Features

- **Preprocessing of Text Data**: The project includes functions to clean and preprocess the raw text data, ensuring it is ready for modeling.
- **Document-Term Matrix Creation**: It utilizes the `CountVectorizer` to transform text documents into a structured document-term matrix.
- **LDA Model Training**: The project trains an LDA model to identify topics in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Key topics and their associated words are visualized using bar charts for better understanding.
- **Model and Vectorizer Saving**: The trained LDA model and vectorizer are saved for future use, allowing analysis of new documents.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages with the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/topic-modeling-lda.git
   cd topic-modeling-lda
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook topic_modeling_lda.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform topic modeling on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The outputs will include identified topics and their key terms.

## Results

Upon completion of the notebook, you will see the identified topics along with their top words. The results provide insights into the themes present in the dataset, making it a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis and understanding large text corpora.

## Saving Models

The trained LDA model (`lda_model.pkl`) and vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`) are saved for future use. You can load them to process new documents or further analyze the topics.
