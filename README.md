# topic-modeling-lda
This project implements topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. It includes preprocessing text data, creating a document-term matrix, and visualizing the identified topics. The LDA model and vectorizer are saved for future analysis of new documents.
